# Week 01 - Line Generation Algorithm 

In this week, we approach two algorithms to draw a line which are
```
- <Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA)>
- <Bresenham>
```

## Digital Differential Analyzer


## Bresenham 


## Implementation

1. Installing [Visual Studio Community ver 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)

2. Setting up [MFC App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWCZlI-7yBY&t=256s)
 
3. Creating a new project named *Draw_Line* with this template and choose the application type which is <Single Document>

4. Adding class <Line_Agorithm> to implement these algorithms

5. Using funct <Ondraw> in "Draw_Line.view" to call funct <DDA> and <Bresenham> for drawing a line
